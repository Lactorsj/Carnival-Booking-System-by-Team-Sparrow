## About Team Sparrow

We are several students from University-365 & Hebei University of Technology in China. In a group project in 2021, member CHEN Yuqi first proposed the name and concept of Team Sparrow. Since then, Team Sparrow was officially established, and CHEN Yuqi also designed its logo and sloganâ€”Small but Fully Functional.

To let you know, Team Sparrow are just a bunch of CS students who want to make something interesting by using their knowledge they know. We are not pro game studio or solution provider, but we have faith to provide you the best we can do.
