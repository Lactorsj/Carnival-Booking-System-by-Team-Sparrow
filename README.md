## Install Instruction

### Step #1 Use Git-clone to get the code from Github

Run this command in your Terminal, such as in Windows 11, we recommended Powershell:

```powershell
git clone git@github.com:Lactorsj/Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow.git
```

A folder named "Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow" with the project code inside will be created, and this is the project root directory, you can rename it anytime.

### Step #2 Download dependency code from Laravel and Node.js

Run these commands in your Terminal:

```powershell
cd .\Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow\

composer install

npm install
```

### Step #3 Database Setup & Migration

You should create a database first. 

You can use this command in your MySQL Command Line Client:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test;
```

After running this command, a database named 'test' will be created.

Open ".env" file in the root directory, modify Line 11-16 to your config.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=yourDatabaseName
DB_USERNAME=yourUserName
DB_PASSWORD=yourPassWord
```

After modify the environment, run this command below in your terminal:

```powershell
php artisan migrate
```

And that's all for the installation!


### Step #5 Run
Use command:

```powershell
php artisan serve
```
 to run on your machine.
