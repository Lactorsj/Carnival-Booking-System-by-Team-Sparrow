## About Team Sparrow

We are several students from University-365 & Hebei University of Technology in China. In a group project in 2021, member CHEN Yuqi first proposed the name and concept of Team Sparrow. Since then, Team Sparrow was officially established, and CHEN Yuqi also designed its logo and sloganâ€”Small but Fully Functional.

To let you know, Team Sparrow are just a bunch of CS students who want to make something interesting by using their knowledge they know. We are not pro game studio or solution provider, but we have faith to provide you the best we can do.

## Install Instruction



### Step #1 Install Laravel Framework to your machine

Make sure you have already install Composer and PHP v8, Run these command below in your terminal(like Powershell)

```
composer create-project "laravel/laravel" example-app

```
After running these command, a folder named 'example-app' with Laravel v9 inside will be created.

Only the '\vendor' folder and the file inside will be used.


### Step #2 Use Git-clone to get the code from Github

```
git clone git@github.com:Lactorsj/Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow.git
```

A folder named "Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow" with the project code inside will be created, and this is the project root directory, you can rename it anytime.

### Step #3 Setup Database

You should create a database first. 

E.g. for Mysql you can use this

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE test;
```

After running this command, a database named 'test' will be created.

Open ".env" file in the root directory, modify Line 11-16 to your config.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=yourDatabaseName
DB_USERNAME=yourUserName
DB_PASSWORD=yourPassWord
```

### Step #4 Copy the 'vendor' folder in the Laravel framework just downloaded through Composer to the project root directory

*This is because the vendor is too big for Git.*

### Step #5 Database Migration

Run these command below in your terminal

```
cd .\Carnival-Booking-System-by-Team-Sparrow\

php artisan migrate
```

And that's all for the installation. You can run 'php artisan serve' to run.
